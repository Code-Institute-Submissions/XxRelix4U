#### Features left to implement:

I wasn't able to implement the features listed here because at the time of working on this project I only had basic understanding of the framework. There was a moment was where I created the necessary models for these features but in the end I decided to deleted code and abandon this feature because I had ran out of time. 

* Bidding - Enables user to compete for for item by offereing the highest price within a specified amount of time.
* recently viewed items -  Enables user to view the last viewed items. This was going to be displayed in a home page and personal profile.
* Watchlist - Enables user to to store artifacts on there account to recall what they would like to buy. 
* Homepage - This was originally in the project however taken out because it became redundent due to the fact other features weren't going to be included. 
on the homepage I wanted to display most viewed items and recommended items e.g items the user would like. 
* Personal profile page - This was originally in the project however near the end of development I deleted iot because it became redundant. On this page i wanted to displayed the users watchlist
, recently viewed and bought items history.

#### Acknowledgements : 
During the development of this project because i had very little time left I used alot of the django mini project 
code. So what i mean is as i was learning and implimenting the mini project i was also editing it to what would eventually become my milestone 4. I changed most areas and made it my own, nevertheless I'm acknowledging some of my code will look similar to the mini project.
